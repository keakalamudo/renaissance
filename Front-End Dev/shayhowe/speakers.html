            <h5>Death to Wireframes: Long Live Rapid Prototyping</h5>

            <p>Static wireframes are a drag on the whole design process. Prototyping makes things a little better by allowing you to stitch together static wireframes or mockups while adding basic interactions. Rapid prototyping with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is even better and faster; it increases collaboration and improves the iteration process. Kill your wireframes. Long live rapid prototyping.</p>

            <h5>What Designers and Strategists Can Learn from Dick Fosbury</h5>

            <p>Dick Fosbury is an American track and field athlete who challenged the conventional approach to the high jump with an unorthodox &#8220;back first&#8221; technique that became known as the Fosbury Flop. His innovative approach to a sport that seemed to have reached its limits was ridiculed at first, with sportswriters labeling him &#8220;the world&#8217;s laziest high jumper&#8221; &#8212; but today variations of the Fosbury Flop are used by almost every high jumper.</p>

            <p>We need to challenge conventions, too. Many of the design conventions used in web, mobile and device interfaces have evolved from systems and processes that no longer connect with our audiences&#8217; realities: a floppy disk as a metaphor to &#8220;save&#8221; information, push buttons as control devices and typography standards derived from mechanical typesetting.</p>

            <p>As designers and strategists, we need to think like Dick Fosbury, to deconstruct analogues, and to free ourselves from outdated ideas so that we can develop the new interfaces and interactions of the future.</p>

            <h5>About Brad</h5>

            <p>Brad Smith is executive director for WebVisions, a conference that explores the future of the web. Most recently he launched &#8220;The Institute for Social Good,&#8221; an organization that connects non-profits with volunteers willing to spend a day building awesome web and mobile apps to change the world for the better.</p>
